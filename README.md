The seven principles of testing
1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible.
3. Early testing saves time and money.
4. Defects cluster together.
5. Beware of the pesticide paradox.
6. Testing is context dependent.
7. Absence-of-errors is a fallacy.
